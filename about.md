We provide updated transit ephemerides for 277 hot Jupiters, based on data from 
the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and  previously reported
transit times which were scraped from the literature in a semi-automated fashion.
For convenience, we also tabulate previously reported transit
times and ephemerides for another 104 hot Jupiters which have not yet been
observed by TESS.
The new ephemerides are useful for
scheduling follow-up observations and
searching for long-term period changes. In total, our database contains 8,693 transit timing measurements for 381 systems.
WASP-12 remains the only system for which a period change
is securely detected.
We remark on other cases of interest, such as a few systems with suggestive (but not
yet convincing) evidence for period changes.
The compilation of light curves, transit times, ephemerides, and timing residuals
are provided on this website, along with the [Python code](https://github.com/transit-timing/transit-timing) that generated them.
